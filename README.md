# Restaurant Chains Analytics  

## Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset from restaurant chains to uncover key insights into customer preferences, restaurant performance, and operational trends. It includes tasks such as identifying popular cuisines, city-wise analysis, and exploring price range distributions. The analysis employs Python libraries for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to deliver actionable insights.  

## Key Steps  

### 1. Data Loading and Cleaning  
- Imported and examined the dataset (`Restaurant_Chains_Dataset.csv`).  
- Handled missing values by imputing unspecified cuisines and addressing inconsistencies.  
- Conducted a preliminary analysis to summarize dataset attributes.  

### 2. Analysis and Insights  
- **Top Cuisines:**  
  - Identified the top three most common cuisines.  
  - Calculated the percentage of restaurants serving each top cuisine.  

- **City Analysis:**  
  - Determined the city with the highest number of restaurants.  
  - Computed the average rating of restaurants in each city.  
  - Identified the city with the highest average rating.  

- **Price Range Distribution:**  
  - Visualized price range distribution using histograms and bar charts.  
  - Calculated the percentage of restaurants in each price range category.  

### 3. Visualization  
- Created insightful charts and visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.  
- Developed geospatial maps with Folium to highlight location-based patterns.  

## Tools and Libraries  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:**  
  - `pandas`  
  - `numpy`  
  - `matplotlib`
