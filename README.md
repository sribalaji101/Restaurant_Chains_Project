# UBER_EATS_Project

**Overview**

This project involves analyzing a dataset from Uber Eats to uncover trends in customer preferences, popular cuisines, and operational insights. The analysis employs Python libraries to clean, explore, and visualize data effectively.

**Key Steps**

**1. Data Loading and Cleaning**

  * Imported and examined the dataset (Uber_Eats_Dataset.csv).

  * Handled missing values by filling unspecified cuisines.

  * Conducted descriptive analysis to summarize data attributes.

**2. Analysis**

  * Identified the top three most common cuisines.

  * Analyzed order trends and customer preferences using statistical and visualization tools.

**3. Visualization**

  * Created insightful visualizations using matplotlib, seaborn, folium, and plotly.express.


**Tools and Libraries**

  * Programming Language: Python

  * Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, folium, plotly

**Key Insights**

* Determined the top cuisines preferred by customers.

* Identified patterns in order frequency and distribution.

* Leveraged geospatial visualizations for location-based insights (e.g., folium).
